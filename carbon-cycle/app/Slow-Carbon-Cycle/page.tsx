            <p>Carbon takes between 100 to 200 mil years to cycle. On average 10 to 100 mil metric tons of carbon move through the slow carbon cycle each year. Humans put 10^15 grams of carbon in the atmosphere while the fast carbon cycle moves 10^16 to 10^17 grams. The slow carbon cycle does 10^13 to 10^14 metric tons. Rain is the start of the slow carbon cycle of atmosphere to the lithosphere is rain. Carbon in the atmosphere combines with water to form weak acid aka carbonic acid. Which falls to earth as rain. This causes weathering that releases stuff. Calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium ions. Rivers carry this to the ocean. The calcium ions combine with bicarbonate ions to form calcium carbonate. This is what dries on your sink. Most of this is used for shell-building. After they die they go to the bottom of the ocean and then that is stored in rock where carbon started. 80 percent of carbon containing rock is made that way. The rest contains carbon from living things. That is in mud. Then heat and pressure turns this into fossil fuels. The slow carbon cycle puts stuff back into the atmosphere through volcanoes. When tectonic plates collide and one goes under another the rocks are heated. Then the heated rocks recombine into silicate minerals that release CO2. When volcanoes erupt they release gas into the atmosphere that covers the land with silicate rock. This restarts the cycle. Volcanoes release about 130 to 380 mil metric tons of CO2 a year. Humans put 30 billion tons a year. 100 to 300 times more. Chemistry regulates the slow carbon cycle. More volcanoes erupt = more heat = more rain = more dissolved rock = more ions = more shells = more carbon rocks. Slow carbon cycle contains a faster component which is the ocean. When air touches water carbon dioxide comes out CO2 dissolves in the ocean and ventilates out of the ocean. CO2 creates more acidic water. The water then produces more bicarbonate ions. The ocean takes more CO2 than it releases because of industry. Over the millennia the ocean will take 85 percent that people put into the atmosphere. Winds, currents and temperatures control the rate that the ocean takes CO2.</p>
